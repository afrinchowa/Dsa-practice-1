# Slicing
# You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

# Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])
# Note: The first character has index 0.

# Slice From the Start
# By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:

# Example
# Get the characters from the start to position 5 (not included):

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])
