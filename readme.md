🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI)
📘 Overview
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that focuses on building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

AI systems use algorithms and data to simulate human-like cognitive abilities. From recommendation engines like YouTube and Netflix to self-driving cars, AI is reshaping industries, making systems smarter and more autonomous.

🧠 What is Artificial Intelligence?
At its core, AI is a system's ability to interpret external data, learn from it, and use that learning to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.

In simple terms:

AI = Machines + Learning + Decision Making

⚙️ Types of Artificial Intelligence
AI is typically categorized into three levels based on its capability:

1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)
Designed for a specific task.

Most AI applications today fall into this category.

Example: Chatbots, Recommendation Systems, Image Recognition.

2. General AI (Strong AI)
Possesses human-level intelligence.

Can perform any intellectual task that a human can.

Still theoretical — not yet achieved.

3. Super AI
Surpasses human intelligence in all aspects — reasoning, creativity, and emotion.

Currently a concept, not a reality.
