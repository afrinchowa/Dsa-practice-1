# Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.

# Upper Case
# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# The upper() method returns the string in upper case:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.upper())
# Lower Case
# Example
# The lower() method returns the string in lower case:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.lower())
# Remove Whitespace
# Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.

# Example
# The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:

a = " Hello, World! "
print(a.strip()) # returns "Hello, World!"
