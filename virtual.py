Python Virtual Environment
What is a Virtual Environment?
A virtual environment in Python is an isolated environment on your computer, where you can run and test your Python projects.

It allows you to manage project-specific dependencies without interfering with other projects or the original Python installation.

Think of a virtual environment as a separate container for each Python project. Each container:

Has its own Python interpreter
Has its own set of installed packages
Is isolated from other virtual environments
Can have different versions of the same package
Using virtual environments is important because:

It prevents package version conflicts between projects
Makes projects more portable and reproducible
Keeps your system Python installation clean
Allows testing with different Python versions
Creating a Virtual Environment
Python has the built-in venv module for creating virtual environments.

To create a virtual environment on your computer, open the command prompt, and navigate to the folder where you want to create your project, then type this command:

ExampleGet your own Python Server
Run this command to create a virtual environment named myfirstproject:

WindowsmacOS/Linux
C:\Users\Your Name> python -m venv myfirstproject
This will set up a virtual environment, and create a folder named "myfirstproject" with subfolders and files, like this:

Result
The file/folder structure will look like this:

myfirstproject
  Include
  Lib
  Scripts
  .gitignore
  pyvenv.cfg
Activate Virtual Environment
To use the virtual environment, you have to activate it with this command:

Example
Activate the virtual environment:

WindowsmacOS/Linux
C:\Users\Your Name> myfirstproject\Scripts\activate
After activation, your prompt will change to show that you are now working in the active environment:

Result
The command line will look like this when the virtual environment is active:

WindowsmacOS/Linux
