# Python Output / Print
# Print Text
# You have already learned that you can use the print() function to display text or output values:

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
print("Hello World!")

# You can use the print() function as many times as you want. Each call prints text on a new line by default:

# Example
print("Hello World!")
print("I am learning Python.")
print("It is awesome!")

# Double Quotes
# Text in Python must be inside quotes. You can use either " double quotes or ' single quotes:

# Example
print("This will work!")
print('This will also work!')

# If you forget to put the text inside quotes, Python will give an error:

# Example
# print(This will cause an error)
# Result:

# SyntaxError: invalid syntax.

# Print Without a New Line
# By default, the print() function ends with a new line.

# If you want to print multiple words on the same line, you can use the end parameter:
