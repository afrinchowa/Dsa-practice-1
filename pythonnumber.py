# Print Numbers
# You can also use the print() function to display numbers:

# However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
print(3)
print(358)
print(50000)

# You can also do math inside the print() function:

# Example
print(3 + 3)
print(2 * 5)

# Mix Text and Numbers
# You can combine text and numbers in one output by separating them with a comma:

# Example
print("I am", 35, "years old.")
